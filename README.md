# Machine_Learning_Python
These three files consist of three seperate machine learning algorithms used to predict the thickness (in cm) of mold products produced by an injection molding
machine. I used one multiple regression analysis and two neural networks: one implementing gradient descent and one implementing the Pytorch library. This project
was supervised by Prof. Peng Wang at the University of Kentucky.
